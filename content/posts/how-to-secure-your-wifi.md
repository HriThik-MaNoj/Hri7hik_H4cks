## Why is it Important to Secure Your Wi-Fi Network?

A Wi-Fi network is a common entry point for attackers. If your Wi-Fi network is not secure, anyone within range can access your network and potentially steal your data.

> **Security Tip:** Your Wi-Fi network extends beyond your physical walls. Someone parked outside your home or office could potentially access an unsecured network.

## How to Secure Your Wi-Fi Network

### 1. Change the Default Password on Your Router

The default password for your router is often easy to guess. Most manufacturers use common passwords like "admin" or "password" that are publicly documented.

**Steps:**
- Access your router's admin panel (usually via 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.1)
- Log in with default credentials (check your router's label)
- Navigate to Administration or Settings
- Change both username and password
- Use a strong, unique password (at least 16 characters)

### 2. Use a Strong Password for Your Wi-Fi Network

A strong password should be at least 12 characters long and include a mix of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.

**Best Practices:**
- Minimum 16 characters
- Mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
- Avoid dictionary words or personal information
- Use a passphrase: e.g., "MyD0gs&3CatsLove2Play!"

### 3. Enable WPA2 or WPA3 Encryption

WPA2 and WPA3 are the most secure encryption protocols for Wi-Fi networks.

**Recommended Settings:**
- **WPA3-Personal** (newest, most secure)
- **WPA2/WPA3-Personal** (transition mode)
- **WPA2-Personal** (if WPA3 not supported)

**Avoid:**
- WEP (outdated, easily cracked)
- WPA (deprecated security protocol)

### 4. Disable WPS

WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup) is a feature that makes it easy to connect to a Wi-Fi network, but it is also a security risk.

**Why disable WPS?**
- PIN-based WPS can be brute-forced
- Physical button WPS can be triggered by anyone with physical access
- Provides minimal convenience for the security risk it introduces

### 5. Additional Hardening Steps

#### Disable Remote Management
Prevent access to router admin panel from the internet.

#### Update Router Firmware
Check for and install firmware updates regularly to patch known vulnerabilities.

#### Disable UPnP
Unless you specifically need it, disable UPnP (Universal Plug and Play) to prevent automatic port forwarding.

#### Use a Guest Network
Isolate IoT devices and guest devices from your main network.

## Conclusion

By following these tips, you can help to keep your Wi-Fi network secure and protect your data from attackers.
